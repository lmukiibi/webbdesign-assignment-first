        <h2>Who am I?</h2>
          <p>I'm a person who is dedicated to my craft and I allways like to do better than what I or you expect. So you can tell that one of my characteristics. <br>
            The second is that I like to complete projects I've started so if we're in business, I'll promis you that the delivery will exceed expectations, i.e. I get things done. <br>
            Creativity is one of my best strength and when I get to work, I sometime loose my self in a vision that I can produce and deliver. And at that point, I already past the goal so to close this statement: I love what I do and let me know if you want to collaborate with me.

        <h2>What do I do?</h2>
          <p>I do a lot of creative things and it's seems like it's all via my system. I'm currently learning skills that I can use in the future and bring to the table. <br>
            Main focus right now is computer science where my main interest is software coding and programming. Second passion is creating media such as: music, video and photo production wich I was kind of born into it so you can say I know what I'm doing when it comes to that area.

        <h2>My goals</h2>

Starting a business is something I'm working on at the moment and in the meantime I'm polishing my skills to lay a foundation so that my goals, or me and people around me have something to stand on.
